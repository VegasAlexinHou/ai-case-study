# Case Study: Peloton

## Beginning

Peloton, the fitness company, was founded on January 3, 2012, with the ambition to bring quality workouts into the home [Schoppa,C 2024; Top Fitness Tech Companies to Watch in 2024. Retrieved from https://www.aitimejournal.com/fitness-tech-companies-to-watch/] (Peloton Interactive, n.d.; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, n.d.).

## Founders and Partners

The founders of Peloton are John Foley, Tom Cortese, Yony Feng, Graham Stanton, and Hisao Kushi, a group of ex-IAC employees. IAC is an American holding company that owns or has owned various internet and media companies, including Match Group, Vimeo, and Dotdash (IAC, 2023; Bloomberg, n.d.; Fortune, 2021).

## Concept Creation

The creation of Peloton was inspired when one of the founders, John Foley, a former Barnes & Noble e-commerce executive, became frustrated with the limited options available for convenient fitness outside of the gym. In an interview on the podcast “How I Built Resilience,” Foley talked about resolving the inconvenience of scheduling and attending studio fitness classes (Raz, 2020). Foley partnered with engineers, designers, and fitness professionals to create the Peloton bike and streaming service that began in 2014 (Warren, 2017).

## Funding

Peloton's primary revenue stream comes from the sale of its exercise bikes and treadmills and the monthly subscription fees for its digital content. Additional funding comes from venture capital and private equity investments, with $1 billion in funding from investors such as Tiger Global Management, TCV, and Fidelity Investments. Major shareholders include Morgan Stanley, Vanguard Group Inc., and Capital World Investors (Marketbeat, 2024; Dealroom, n.d.; Bloomberg, 2019; Fintel, n.d.).

## Finding Their Niche

Peloton aimed to provide quality fitness programs outside of gyms and fitness centers through their bikes and streaming programs (Schoppa, 2024; Bloomberg, n.d.; Warren, 2017).

## Clientele

Peloton’s intended customers are typically health and fitness conscious and usually affluent. Entry prices for their equipment start at almost $2,500, appealing to higher-income households. As of 2021, Peloton stated it had 5.4 million members in both subscriptions and digital app use, reaching a $15 billion market cap (Herrick, 2024; BenchmarkONE, n.d.; CompaniesMarketCap.com, n.d.).

## Creating the Market Provides an Advantage

Peloton offers a more convenient way to access a better fitness experience outside of the gym through its streaming service that accompanies the exercise equipment. This infrastructure allows them to offer a wide variety of classes and instructors faster and better than the competition, extending and endearing the Peloton brand to users. As of 2020, Peloton’s stock soared over 60%, reaching a market capitalization more than double the value of competitors like Planet Fitness (Patel, 2020; NoGood, 2022).

## Creating and Leading in Technology Development

Peloton has many technologies that it uses for its company, with the advantage being that it created most of the technology itself and holds proprietary authority over most of it. The biggest technology is Interactive Touchscreen Displays, which allow users to access digital information, live and recorded classes, and real-time metrics to evaluate and measure progress and performance. Peloton also implemented AI in their technology, using machine learning algorithms to recommend workout strategies based on users' preferences and needs from past workout data. This leads to tracking performance, measuring vital information, and providing feedback, allowing programs to adapt workouts for user needs (Lande, 2022; Schoppa, 2024; LinkedIn, n.d.; Peloton, n.d.).

## Fitness, and Now Media?

Peloton is in the fitness and technology field, though their streaming service has considered them a media company by some and a possible disrupter (Charlotte, 2015).

## Trendsetters

Peloton has been a leader in providing an elevated experience in exercise for the out-of-gym experience. Their streaming service and touch screen technology allowed them to be a leader and a trendsetter above the competition. Their streaming service has them creating content for consumers, making them considered a media company as well as fitness. They have built strong digital content and community and continued expansion worldwide against increasing competition and loss in market share in certain areas (Backlinko, n.d.; FutureFit, n.d.).

## Competitors

Other companies in the field include Life Fitness, Bowflex, NordicTrack, Precor, and Technogym. The competition in the AI space includes Tonal, Mirror, Hydrow, Tempo, and Echelon. Peloton remains the leader in this space thanks to their proprietary technology [Garage Gym Reviews. (n.d.). 10 Best Peloton Alternatives. Retrieved from https://www.garagegymreviews.com/best-peloton-alternatives] (CB Insights, n.d.; Craft, n.d.).

## Impact

Peloton’s impact has been significant and disrupted the fitness industry. Many companies before Peloton offered home fitness, but not a way to connect to the user in their homes on a regular basis. Peloton also offered a better avenue to connect to other users and build a community. Peloton was able to build a stronger fitness interest and generate a market from this trend. Currently, they are facing subscription losses and loss in market share. They also received negative feedback on TV ads which required public relation strategies. Through that, they have maintained intended value (Lawson, 2024; Business Insider, 2022; Capital Letter, n.d.).

## Core Metrics

Some of the core metrics that are used for fitness industries are membership growth and retention of the members and how it translates to revenue growth (Curley, 2024). Engagement and use metrics are also used to measure the stability of the service provided by the company. Though subscription rates have fallen and market share has slimmed in certain areas, they are still performing well enough to keep substantial value. New leadership has been implemented in certain areas and they are looking to make improvements to streamline revenue. Per Q3 Final Year 2024 Earnings News Release, Peloton is also looking for cost reduction in key areas to keep the customer experience engaging and important to the user (Glofox, n.d.; Peloton Investor Relations, n.d.).

## Performance

Because Peloton has built a recognizable name, market value has maintained. Similar to companies like Nike, Apple, Target, and Disney, the name lends tremendous value to leverage in the market to maintain investors and interest from the public (Haberlah, n.d.; MarketWatch, n.d.).

## Recommended Ventures for the Future

A possible extension of Peloton that could benefit them is a sequential video series of cooking shows that showcase healthy cooking and eating. These would be considered entertainment by the viewer, but also represent the Peloton brand that is cohesive with the fitness experience. They could also sell advertising in the program and do product placement and promotion for appropriate products. This could extend through cooking newsletters and e-magazines that also build communities and groups, linked to local grocery stores for ease in buying the product, even having it delivered.

This recommendation would build an entertainment base that could capture a customer that is not interacting with them now. Cooking enthusiasts might come along to learn cooking tips, especially healthy ones. Even if the user does not translate to a fitness user, they might be a consistent viewer whose metrics can translate to gaining advertising dollars within the show.

Peloton could also offer apparel and fitness accessories with the Peloton brand. They can create a baseline set of products that are free or less expensive. Achieving challenges would reap a coveted product that those in the Peloton community would aspire to get, especially when they see someone in public wearing it.

This recommendation provides a tangible product for the consumer to hold in their hand and/or wear on their person. Promotional and marketing experts rely on logo material for various reasons to reach the public. The plan would need the right execution taking into account its size (Totally Promotional, n.d.; Promotional Products Work, n.d.; Shopify, n.d.; McKinsey, n.d.).
